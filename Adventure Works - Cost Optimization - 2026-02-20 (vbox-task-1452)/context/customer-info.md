## Task
**Cost Optimization: Assessment & Remediation**

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><strong>Adventure Works</strong>'s Azure infrastructure analysis reveals potential annual savings of <strong>$50,849.49</strong>, representing a <strong>17.77%</strong> cost reduction from the current annual spend of <strong>$286,088.41</strong>.</p>

<p>Key cost optimization strategies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purchase reservations to save <strong>$17,562.00</strong> (6.14% savings).</li>
  <li>Purchase savings plan for compute to save <strong>$10,392.00</strong> (3.63% savings).</li>
  <li>Downscale App Service Plans to save <strong>$9,868.25</strong> (3.45% savings).</li>
  <li>Enable Azure Hybrid Benefits to save <strong>$5,503.63</strong> (1.92% savings).</li>
  <li>Downscale disks to save <strong>$3,600.93</strong> (1.26% savings).</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementing these optimizations can enhance operational efficiency by aligning resource usage with actual demand, reducing over-provisioning, and leveraging cost-effective Azure features such as reserved instances and storage tier adjustments. These measures not only lower costs but also improve governance and compliance by enforcing policies that prevent resource mismanagement and ensure consistent tagging and monitoring. Additionally, the proposed strategies can streamline infrastructure management, enabling <strong>Adventure Works</strong> to focus on scaling its operations while maintaining a cost-efficient and secure Azure environment.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Analysis and remediation of cost optimization opportunities across all subscriptions in scope, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Orphaned resources</strong> — unattached disks, NICs, public IPs, snapshots</li>
  <li><strong>Rightsizing</strong> — VMs, SQL DBs, App Services, Kubernetes, Storage, and other services</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration tuning</strong> — optimal tier selection for EventHub, CosmosDB, Cognitive Services, and others</li>
  <li><strong>Idle resources</strong> — deallocation scheduling and storage optimization</li>
  <li><strong>Suboptimal pricing</strong> — Reserved Instances, Hybrid Benefits, cross-region optimizations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prioritized backlog of recommendations with estimated savings</li>
  <li>Implementation of approved optimizations</li>
  <li>Executive review briefing with KPI summary (tasks completed, resources optimized, projected annual savings, ROI)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plan</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Kick-off</strong> — scope confirmation, review vBox cost recommendations, confirm subscriptions in scope</li>
  <li><strong>Assessment review</strong> — walk through identified recommendations by category, estimate savings potential per area</li>
  <li><strong>Execution</strong> — weekly calls to assign action items, implement approved optimizations, track progress and resolve blockers</li>
  <li><strong>Custom analysis</strong> — address special requests for scripts, resource-specific deep dives, or policy adjustments</li>
  <li><strong>Executive briefing</strong> — present results: completed tasks, optimized resources, achieved and projected savings, ROI</li>
</ol>
